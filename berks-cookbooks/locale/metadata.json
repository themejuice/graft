{"name":"locale","version":"2.0.0","description":"Installs/Configures locale","long_description":"# locale cookbook\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/locale.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/locale) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/locales.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/locale)\n\nSets the default system locale for this system. You can see which locales are available by running `locale -a`.\n\nOn Debian based systems, this recipe sets the locale by running `update-locale` and on Fedora, it uses `localectl`.\n\nOn RHEL based systems, the recipe operates on the /etc/sysconfig/i18n file directly because there is no standard command line tool to change the system locale settings.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Platforms\n\n- Debian/Ubuntu\n- RHEL or derivatives\n- Fedora\n\n### Chef\n\n- Chef 12.1+\n\n### Cookbooks\n\n- none\n\n## Attributes\n\n- `node['locale']['lang']` -- the value for \"LANG\": defaults to \"en_US.utf8\"\n- `node['locale']['lc_all']` -- the value for \"LC_ALL\": defaults to \"en_US.utf8\"\n\nNote that you cannot set \"LC_ALL\" on Fedora. It is a documented limitation; see \"man 5 locale.conf\". So this recipe simply ignores LC_ALL for Fedora.\n\n## Usage\n\nInclude the default recipe in your run list.\n\n## License & Authors\n\n**Author:** Cookbook Engineering Team ([cookbooks@chef.io](mailto:cookbooks@chef.io))\n\n**Copyright:** 2016, Chef Software, Inc.\n\n```\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n","maintainer":"Chef Software, Inc.","maintainer_email":"cookbooks@chef.io","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"ubuntu":">= 0.0.0","debian":">= 0.0.0","centos":">= 0.0.0","redhat":">= 0.0.0","scientific":">= 0.0.0","fedora":">= 0.0.0","oracle":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"source_url":"https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/locale","issues_url":"https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/locale/issues","chef_version":">= 12.1","ohai_version":{}}
